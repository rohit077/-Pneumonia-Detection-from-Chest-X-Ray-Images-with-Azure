# Pneumonia-Detection-from-Chest-X-Ray-Images-with-Azure

This repository contains the project for **Future Ready Talent Virtual Internship**, where the goal of the project is to build **a product that helps doctors quickly identify cases of pneumonia in children**. I want to build a classification system that:
* Can help flag serious cases
* Quickly identify healthy cases
* And, generally, act as a diagnostic aid for doctors
